                <h2>The Team</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Team Srijan is one of the oldest technical clubs of BIT Mesra, which has been growing steadily since 2007. It is a group of undergraduate students from various branches of engineering who work together to design, conceive and manufacture the prototype of a formula race car to participate in Formula Student competitions held across the globe. We are bonded together by our passion to innovate and apply our knowledge to practical scenarios. For the smooth functioning of the team, we have a technical and management division in our team. The technical division takes care of the engineering aspects involved in designing and fabricating a formula race car prototype. The management division ensures efficient project management throughout the formula season. The engineering marvels that are conceived in the workshop are the result of the efforts put in by every member of the team.</p>
