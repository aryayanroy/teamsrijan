            <p class="text-justify">Formula Student is an international engineering competition organized by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) that challenges university students to design, build, test, and race small-scale formula-style racing cars. This multidisciplinary competition, open to teams from universities worldwide, involves students from engineering, business, and marketing backgrounds. The event comprises both static and dynamic segments, including design evaluations, cost assessments, business presentations, as well as acceleration, skid-pad, autocross, endurance, and fuel economy tests. Participants must adhere to strict guidelines to ensure safety and promote innovation, with cars undergoing technical inspections before dynamic events. Formula Student includes categories for internal combustion engine vehicles, electric-powered vehicles, and a concept class for teams presenting comprehensive designs without a physical car. This competition offers practical applications of engineering theories and helps students develop project management, teamwork, and problem-solving skills. With competitions held in various countries such as the India, Germany and Italy, Formula Student enjoys global reach and significant support from major automotive and engineering firms. This backing not only provides valuable networking opportunities but also enhances career prospects for participating students, bridging the gap between academic learning and real-world engineering challenges.</p>
